## Getting Started

First, make sure you're running the following versions of `node` and `pnpm`:

```bash
node 22.14.0
pnpm 10.7.0
```

After setting up Node and PNPM, install the dependencies with `pnpm`:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
